# Aurorae

Goal: make the hard work more accessible

- divinumofficium (Ref)
- psalm tone generater (Ref)
- gregorio + gregobase (Ref)

Aurorae stands on the shoulders of these giants to bring their hardwork to you.

## Core Approach
- seperate data sources from software for easier editing and correction
- create an access layer that will enable the next generation of software to make use of all the work done in these greate projects.

## Data Folder
The data folder contains all the files that are used to populate the sqlite schema.

## Test Suite
Divinum Officium's custom database file structure is very difficult to parse, and perl is not my strongest language. Therefore I've included a test suite to ensure that the Aurorae project is in line with the gold standard for the next 100 years. 

## Gregobase Corpus
This is just so I don't lose the link
