# 🕊️ Sacred Minimalism — Design System

**Sacred Minimalism** blends the contemplative stillness of sacred art with the discipline of modern minimalism.  
It seeks not austerity but *reverence* — balancing proportion, silence, and light to create a digital space for reflection.

## 🎨 Color Palette

Sacred Minimalism uses a **liturgical palette** — symbolic, restrained, and inspired by natural materials: parchment, ink, stone, and candlelight.

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| **Oxblood (Primary)** | ![#4b0f0f](https://via.placeholder.com/20/4b0f0f/000000?text=+) | `#4b0f0f` | Primary accent color; headings, icons, and interactive focus. Evokes tradition, sacrifice, and depth. |
| **Oxblood Light** | ![#b76b6b](https://via.placeholder.com/20/b76b6b/000000?text=+) | `#b76b6b` | Secondary accent for dark mode and highlights. |
| **Parchment (Background)** | ![#f8f5f0](https://via.placeholder.com/20/f8f5f0/000000?text=+) | `#f8f5f0` | Main background; evokes aged paper and humility. |
| **Ivory White** | ![#fffdf8](https://via.placeholder.com/20/fffdf8/000000?text=+) | `#fffdf8` | Section backgrounds and reading surfaces. |
| **Charcoal Gray (Text)** | ![#2e2e2e](https://via.placeholder.com/20/2e2e2e/000000?text=+) | `#2e2e2e` | Body text for high readability. |
| **Ash Gray (Secondary Text)** | ![#6b6b6b](https://via.placeholder.com/20/6b6b6b/000000?text=+) | `#6b6b6b` | Secondary copy and marginalia. |
| **Gold Accent** | ![#c8a951](https://via.placeholder.com/20/c8a951/000000?text=+) | `#c8a951` | Optional decorative accent (links, dividers, initials). Symbolizes illumination and divinity. |
| **Midnight Gray (Dark Mode)** | ![#0f0f0f](https://via.placeholder.com/20/0f0f0f/000000?text=+) | `#0f0f0f` | Dark theme background; evokes stone, quiet, and depth. |

**Principles for color:**
- Never use pure black or white; always off-tones for warmth.
- Limit accents to one dominant color (Oxblood) and one secondary (Gold).
- Allow neutral backgrounds to represent silence and stillness.

## ✒️ Typography

| Type | Example | Purpose |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Serif (Primary)** | *Playfair Display*, *EB Garamond*, *Cormorant Garamond* | For headings and liturgical text; humanist, timeless, and formal. |
| **Sans-Serif (Supportive)** | *Inter*, *Optima*, *Gill Sans* | For navigation, labels, and system text — clean, secondary presence. |

**Rules:**
- Headings: 1.4× line-height for solemn rhythm.  
- Body text: 1.7–1.8× line-height for meditative reading.  
- Limit font weights; rely on scale and spacing for emphasis.  
- Center key titles (e.g., “Credo in Unum Deum”) to mimic manuscript layout.

## 📏 Layout & Proportion

1. **Single Column (Reading Mode)**  
   - Max width: ~42–48rem.  
   - Margins wide for whitespace; every page feels like a leaf of a missal.

2. **Two Column (Bilingual Mode)**  
   - Equal width for Latin and English.  
   - Mirror spacing; text alignment follows liturgical symmetry.  
   - Narrow divider or gutter (1.5rem) representing the fold of a book.

3. **Spacing Scale**  
   - Use powers of two: `4px, 8px, 16px, 32px, 64px`.  
   - Vertical rhythm should feel musical, not mechanical.

---

## 🕯️ Motion & Interaction

- **Animation:** Soft fades and slow scroll reveals (`0.6–0.8s ease-out`).  
- **Hover States:** Gentle shadow lift or color warmth — not motion.  
- **Focus States:** Oxblood border glow or underline (`focus:ring-[#4b0f0f]`).  
- **Transitions:** Should feel like turning a page, not loading a UI.

---

## 🧭 Navigation & Structure

- **Top bar:** Minimal, no visual dominance; aligned to liturgical hierarchy.  
- **Sections:** Introduced with centered headers and subtle dividers.  
- **Breadcrumbs:** Optional; quiet, typographically styled — no icons.  
- **Dark mode:** Preserve same hierarchy; swap parchment for midnight tones.

---

## 🪶 Texture & Materials

- Background textures (e.g., parchment grain) provide warmth.  
- Avoid glossy gradients; favor matte, tactile surfaces.  
- Subtle inner shadows evoke printed ink pressed into vellum.  
- Depth comes from layering and light, not color contrast.

## 🧩 Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Header** | Centered logo with small cross or typographic mark; fixed but discreet. |
| **Text Blocks** | Clean paragraphs with 1.5rem bottom margin; allow breathing space. |
| **Dividers** | Thin (`1px`) line in gold or oxblood; may use dotted line for manuscript feel. |
| **Buttons** | Rounded minimal (4px radius), filled with oxblood, hover deepens shade. |
| **Forms** | Ivory background, oxblood borders, subtle drop shadow. |
| **Quotes / Verses** | Center-aligned, italicized, often with gold or gray line accent. |

## 🔤 Tone & Voice

- **Pace:** Slow, deliberate, rhythmic.  
- **Voice:** Scholarly but contemplative; aesthetic of devotion.  
- **Goal:** Transform reading into *prayerful interaction*, not consumption.
